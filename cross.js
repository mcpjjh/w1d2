As a human being
I want to cross the street
So that I can get to the other side

1. Get to the corner
- Is there a traffic light?
  - if yes, look at it
    - does it show a walking man?
      - if yes, start walking*
    - does it show a red hand?
      - if yes, wait
  - If not
    - Is there a zebra crossing?
      - If so:
        - Are there cars coming from the right?
        - Are there cars coming from the left?
          - If not
            - start walking*

How do I walk?
1. Put one foot in front of the other
2. Adjust your balance
3. Put the other foot in front
4. GO TO 1
